Lawyer Appointment Management Application 
We want to build an Appointment Management application for Law Firm companies. Assume 
that the companies are small with 10 or fewer lawyers in each of them 
1. Firms can have lawyers with multiple specialties (e.g. divorce lawyer, criminal lawyer, 
property dispute lawyer, etc) 
2. Each lawyer in each firm may be available for a certain duration of time. 
3. Each lawyer may charge different charges for the appointment 
Assumptions: 
You can seed data for these 
1. Lawyer 
2. Speciality 
3. Availability 
4. Cost per Appointment 
Assume each appointment takes 30 min. 
Demonstrate: 
1. Book an appointment with a lawyer. 
2. If the number of bookings goes beyond lawyer availability show “Appointment not 
available” 
3. For a given lawyer, see complete appointment history.
